Hello, my name is Gigi.

This is my automation Project.
It showcases web automation using the following tools and practices:
- Playwright with Python
- Pytest for test execution
- Git for version control
- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern

The automation is implemented on a real website: https://www.jw.org/en/
